# Blendings
def blend_images(image1: Picture, image2: Picture, **kwargs) -> Picture:
    """
    This function blends two images of the same size and mode together using a specified alpha value.
    The blending is done using the `Image.blend` function from the PIL library, which combines the two
    images by mixing their pixel values based on the alpha parameter.

    Args:
        image1 (Picture): The first image (a `Picture` object) to blend.
        image2 (PÃŸicture): The second image (a `Picture` object) to blend.
        alpha (float, optional): A float value between 0 and 1 representing the blending factor.
                                 Default is 0.5, meaning an equal blend of both images.
                                 An alpha of 0.0 means the result will be entirely `image1`,
                                 and an alpha of 1.0 means the result will be entirely `image2`.

    Returns:
        Picture: A new `Picture` object containing the blended image.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the two images do not have the same size or mode.

    Example:
        >>> image1 = Picture(image1_data)
        >>> image2 = Picture(image2_data)
        >>> blended_image = blend_images(image1, image2, alpha=0.7)

    Notes:
        - Both images must have the same size and mode (e.g., both should be in RGB or RGBA).
        - The alpha value determines the influence of each image in the final blend. A value of 0.5 results in an equal blend of both images.
        - The result is a new image that blends the pixel values of the two input images based on the alpha value.

def superimpose_pictures(picture_1, picture_2):

    Superimpose Two Pictures

    This function overlays one picture on top of another, using the alpha channel of the second image
    to determine transparency. The second image is pasted on top of the first one, and the result is returned
    as a new `Picture`.

    Args:
        picture_1 (Picture): The base image onto which the second image will be pasted.
        picture_2 (Picture): The image to be superimposed on top of the first image.

    Returns:
        Picture: A new `Picture` object with the second image superimposed on top of the first image.

    Example:
        >>> picture_1 = Picture(image1_data)
        >>> picture_2 = Picture(image2_data)
        >>> superimposed_picture = superimpose_pictures(picture_1, picture_2)

    Notes:
        - The function assumes that `picture_2` has an alpha channel (RGBA) for transparency.
        - The superimposition is done at the (0, 0) coordinate, aligning the top-left corners of the two images.
        - This function does not modify the original `picture_1`, instead it returns a new `Picture` with the superimposed images.

# GRID

def create_grid_of_pictures(pictures: list[Picture], **kwargs) -> Picture:

    Create a Grid of Pictures

    This function arranges a list of `Picture` objects into a grid layout. The grid is constructed based on
    the number of pictures provided, and each picture is resized to fit a uniform image size. The resulting
    grid of pictures is returned as a new `Picture` object.

    Args:
        pictures (list[Picture]): A list of `Picture` objects to be arranged into the grid.
        grid_size (tuple, optional): A tuple representing the number of columns and rows in the grid.
                                      If not provided, the grid will be created with an optimal square
                                      layout based on the number of pictures. Default is determined
                                      by the square root of the number of pictures.
        image_size (tuple, optional): A tuple representing the size (width, height) of each individual image
                                      in the grid. Default is (720, 720).

    Returns:
        Picture: A new `Picture` object containing the collage of images arranged in the grid.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list of pictures is empty.

        - The images are resized to fit the specified `image_size`, and if necessary, the images are centered
          on a blank white background to maintain the aspect ratio.
        - If the number of pictures exceeds the grid size (cols * rows), extra images are ignored.
